        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Codeland was founded in the early 21st century by a group of
          passionate programmers, artists, and engineers who dreamed of creating
          a place where technology and creativity could thrive side by side.
          Originally a small innovation hub, it quickly grew into a vibrant town
          known for celebrating the art and science of coding. The name Codeland
          reflects its mission: to honor the impact of programming on society
          while fostering a creative and inclusive environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the digital age accelerated, Codeland blossomed into a global
          destination for visionaries. Hackathons evolved into annual festivals,
          garage startups became iconic institutions, and streets were named
          after programming languages. The architecture—sleek, smart, and
          inspired by logic itself—turns every stroll into a walk through
          digital history. From interactive coding academies to open-source
          cafés, Codeland's culture is deeply rooted in community learning and
          playful innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the 2040s, Codeland had earned its place as a beacon of ethical
          tech and sustainable design. Its labs birthed some of the world's most
          beloved tools and platforms, while its gardens, studios, and workshops
          nurtured both creativity and compassion. Yet through all its
          evolution, Codeland stayed true to its roots: a place built on
          curiosity, collaboration, and the belief that the best ideas start
          with a simple line of code.
